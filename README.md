# Welcome to Crossing Paths!

> A social media app for people who love to Cross-Stitch! 

## The Idea

One day I was sitting with graph paper and markers copying a cross-stitch design from the internet and thought it would be cool if there was a way to create designs using a computer. From that idea, I decided to make this project adding a few other features to make it more like a social media app.

## Features

This app allows users to create, post, and organize cross-stitch designs. <br />
Features include:
* A Homepage where a user can organize their designs into three categories and add new designs
* A Friends page where users can manage who they follow and search for users to follow
    * Users can click on their friend's username to see their page
* An Explore page where users can see public designs and designs posted by people they follow
    * Users can follow people from this page as well
    * Users can add designs they see on the Explore page to their own page
* A Create page where users can design a cross-stitch pattern
    * Users can choose the size of their project and colors used in the project
